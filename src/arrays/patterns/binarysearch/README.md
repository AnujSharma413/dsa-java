# Binary Search – Basics

This folder contains the foundational implementation of Binary Search
based on Aditya Verma’s Binary Search pattern.

The focus is on understanding:
- Why binary search works
- How search space is reduced
- Correct loop conditions and boundaries

---

## Problem Covered

### 1. Binary Search (Classical)

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index of the target
if it exists, otherwise return -1.

---

## Key Concepts
- Binary search works on sorted data due to monotonic behaviour
- Search space is reduced by half after every comparison
- Proper mid calculation avoids integer overflow
- Loop condition `low <= high` is critical to avoid missing elements

---

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

This is **Lecture 1** of the Binary Search pattern series.
