# Binary Search Pattern (Aditya Verma)

This folder contains a **complete collection of Binary Search problems**  
implemented in Java, following the **Binary Search pattern taught by Aditya Verma**.

The goal of this section is not just to write Binary Search code,  
but to **master how to think in terms of search space reduction** and  
apply Binary Search in multiple problem variations.

* * *

## 📌 What This Folder Represents

*   This is the **first major pattern** in the DSA journey

*   All problems are solved using **Binary Search logic**

*   Each problem focuses on identifying:

    *   Sorted or monotonic behaviour

    *   Correct search space

    *   Boundary conditions

    *   Variations of mid handling


This folder builds the **foundation for advanced problem solving**.

* * *

## 📂 Problems Covered

### 🔹 Basic Binary Search

*   Binary Search (Classic)

*   Binary Search on Reverse Sorted Array

*   Binary Search when Order is Not Known


### 🔹 First / Last Occurrence Variations

*   First Occurrence of an Element

*   Last Occurrence of an Element

*   Count Occurrences in a Sorted Array


### 🔹 Floor / Ceil / Closest Element

*   Find Floor of an Element

*   Find Ceil of an Element

*   Minimum Difference Element in Sorted Array

*   Next Greatest Letter


### 🔹 Infinite & Special Arrays

*   Search in Infinite Sorted Array

*   Find First `1` in Infinite Binary Sorted Array


### 🔹 Rotated & Nearly Sorted Arrays

*   Search in Rotated Sorted Array

*   Count Rotations in Sorted Rotated Array

*   Search in Nearly Sorted Array


### 🔹 Peak & Bitonic Arrays

*   Find Peak Element

*   Maximum Element in Bitonic Array

*   Search in Bitonic Array


* * *

## 🧠 Key Learnings from This Pattern

*   Binary Search works only when **search space is monotonic**

*   Every Binary Search problem reduces to:

    *   Defining correct `low` and `high`

    *   Choosing correct condition to move left or right

*   Mid calculation should avoid overflow:

        mid = low + (high - low) / 2


*   Loop condition `low <= high` is critical

*   One wrong boundary can break the entire logic


* * *

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log n)

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1)


(All solutions are iterative and optimized)

## 📚 Learning Source

All problems in this folder are practiced and implemented based on  
**Aditya Verma’s Binary Search Pattern (YouTube Series)**.

This folder completes the **Binary Search Pattern Phase** of the DSA journey.

## 🚀 What’s Next

*   Practice these Binary Search problems on coding platforms (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)

*   Move to the **next DSA pattern**

*   Focus on applying Binary Search thinking in unfamiliar problems
